## Abstract 
Dynamic inference networks, aimed at promoting computational efficiency, go along an adaptive executing path for a given sample. Prevalent methods typically assign a router for each convolutional block and sequentially make block-by-block executing decisions, without considering the relations during the dynamic inference. In this paper, we model the relations for dynamic inference from two aspects: the routers and the samples. We design a novel type of router called the relational router to model the relations among routers for a given sample. In principle, the cur- rent relational router aggregates the contextual features of preceding routers by graph convolution and propagates its router features to subsequent ones, making the executing decision for the current block in a long-range manner. Fur- thermore, we model the relation between samples by intro- ducing a Sample Relation Module (SRM), encouraging cor- related samples to go along correlated executing paths. As a whole, we call our method the Relational Dynamic Inference Network (RDI-Net). Extensive experiments on CIFAR- 10/100 and ImageNet show that RDI-Net achieves state-of- the-art performance and computational cost reduction.
